# golang-minesweeper
minesweeper implemented using go
This is based upoon work down with Elliot Barlas, where we implemented minesweeper in c++. In learning golang, I thought this would be a good way to start.

Build using the normal go build, then run ./golang_minesweeper -h from console to see options.
